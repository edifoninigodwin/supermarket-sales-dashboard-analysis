# Supermarket Sales Analytics – Excel Dashboard
Supermarkets run on thin margins and face the daily challenge of balancing sales growth, customer satisfaction, and inventory efficiency. This project analyzes real supermarket data to answer critical business questions: Which branches perform best? What do customers prefer? When do sales peak? And how can profitability improve?

## Why This Project Matters

The retail sector depends on data-driven insights to stay competitive. By exploring supermarket sales with Excel, this project goes beyond raw numbers to uncover:

The buying behavior of customers across demographics.

The impact of membership programs on loyalty and retention.

The patterns in sales across time, products, and cities.

The profitability puzzle, linking costs (COGS), gross margin %, and net profit.

## Dataset
- <a href="https://github.com/edifoninigodwin/supermarket-sales-dashboard-analysis/blob/main/supermarket%20sales.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Approach

Instead of jumping straight into dashboards, the work began with data preparation and cleaning:
✔️ Standardizing inconsistent entries (e.g., gender codes).
✔️ Extracting new time-based features (Month, Day).
✔️ Formatting numeric values for clarity.
✔️ Structuring the dataset into pivot-friendly tables.

Once the foundation was set, pivot tables, charts, and slicers powered a dynamic dashboard for analysis.


## Key Insights

📌 Revenue Drivers

Naypyitaw branch is the top performer ($110K+ sales).

Food & Beverages lead product categories ($56K revenue).

📌 Customer Behavior

Females spend more than males.

Membership card holders = higher repeat purchases (50.85% of customers).

📌 Sales Patterns

Peak sales in January, around 7 PM, and on Saturdays.

These patterns guide restocking and staffing strategies.

📌 Payments

Cash (34.7%), E-wallet (34.1%), and Credit Card (31.2%) → nearly balanced.

📌 Profitability Challenge

COGS = $307K vs. Profit = $15K → Gross Margin just 4.78%.

Indicates a need for tighter cost control.
